# Lab 1 Part Two – Assembly Language LED Blinking

## Course Information
- Course: 04-633 A – Embedded Systems Development (Learning about Electronics)
- Institution: Carnegie Mellon University Africa
- Assignment: Lab 1 Part Two – Assembly Language LED Blinking

## Assignment Overview
This assignment reinforces low-level programming concepts using **Assembly Language (ASM)** on the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**. As outlined in the assignment document, the task involves writing an assembly program to blink LEDs, compiling the code using **MPLAB X IDE**, and validating the design through **Proteus simulation**.

The assignment also emphasizes correct register handling, bank switching, delay implementation, and adaptability to assembler syntax differences.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this lab are to:
- Write an Assembly Language program for the PIC16F877A microcontroller
- Configure I/O pins as digital outputs
- Implement a software-based delay routine to create visible LED blinking
- Use an infinite loop to ensure continuous operation
- Modify the program to blink **multiple LEDs on different output pins** to achieve full marks
- Compile and simulate the program without syntax or runtime errors

## Program Description
The Assembly program configures **PORTA** pins as outputs by correctly accessing the TRISA register through bank switching. A software delay routine is implemented using nested loops to generate a human-visible delay.  

The program supports:
- Blinking of a **single LED** connected to RA3
- Blinking of **three LEDs** connected to RA1, RA2, and RA3, either sequentially or individually depending on program logic

An infinite loop ensures that the LEDs continue blinking indefinitely, as required by the assignment.

## Hardware and Simulation Setup
In accordance with the assignment instructions, the Proteus simulation includes:
- PIC16F877A microcontroller
- Three LEDs with current-limiting resistors
- 4 MHz crystal oscillator with capacitors
- Power supply connections (VDD and VSS)
- Reset circuitry (MCLR with pull-up resistor)

The compiled HEX file generated by MPLAB X IDE is loaded into the PIC microcontroller for simulation.

## Tools and Software
- MPLAB X IDE v5.35  
- MPASM Assembler  
- Proteus Design Suite  

## Files and Documentation Included
The ZIP folder attached to this submission contains **all materials related to the assignment**, including:
- Assembly source code files (`.asm`)
- Complete MPLAB X project files
- Proteus simulation files

## Functionality and Results
- LEDs connected to PORTA blink at a visible rate determined by the software delay routine
- The blinking process runs continuously using an infinite loop
- Multiple LEDs blink correctly on different output pins, satisfying the main task requirement
- Proteus simulation confirms correct circuit connections and program execution
